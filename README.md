This is a JavaScript Project I worked on which was assigned by The Odin Project.
With this project I learned about Factory Functions and Private Variables.

For now this game is fully dependant on user input but in the future I plan on adding a Player vs. Computer mode. 

Languages used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
